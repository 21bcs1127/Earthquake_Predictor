# Earthquake_Predictor
Earthquake Magnitude Prediction
# Overview
This project aims to predict the magnitude of earthquakes based on historical earthquake data. The dataset used in this project, previous_earthquakes, contains information on earthquake events, including their longitude, latitude, depth, and magnitude. The goal is to build a model that can accurately forecast earthquake magnitudes using these features.

# Project Description
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict earthquake magnitudes. By analyzing historical earthquake data, the model can identify patterns and make predictions about future earthquake magnitudes based on the given features: longitude, latitude, and depth.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named previous_earthquakes.csv. It contains the following columns:

longitude: The longitude coordinate of the earthquake event.
latitude: The latitude coordinate of the earthquake event.
depth: The depth of the earthquake event in kilometers.
magnitude: The magnitude of the earthquake event (target variable).

# Model Training
Train the Decision Tree model
